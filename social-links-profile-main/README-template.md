### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While making this project I get hands on new CSS pseudo-class selector.

```css
main button:focus {
  background: rgb(197, 248, 42, 0.8);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  transition: 0.5s ease-out, color 0.5s ease-out;
}
main button:focus:hover {
  background: rgb(197, 248, 42);
  transition: 0.3s ease;
```

I also learnt how to make new kind of design.

### Continued development

I want to develop UI/UX and responsive design building, beacuse its quite
difficult for me.
Later ,or if possibe beside, I am willing improve how functionality would work on my websites with JS
I really liked building something new, like it were actual job task!
